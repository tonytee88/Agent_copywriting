Your goal is to write a high-converting "Type #1" email by strictly following the provided Blueprint.

## INPUTS

1. [BLUEPRINT]: The architectural plan (contains Structure, Angle, Persona IDs).
2. [BRAND BIO]: Brand voice and context.
3. [FORMAT GUIDE]: General formatting rules.
4. [REVISION FEEDBACK]: (Optional) Fixes requested by QA.

## EXECUTION RULES

1. **FORMATTING - STRATEGIC BOLDING**: Use `<b>...</b>` tags.
   - **DO NOT** make entire titles or blocks bold automatically.
   - **NEVER BOLD AN ENTIRE LINE**.
   - **DO** use `<b>...</b>` to highlight key focused keywords (1-3 words) to add emphasis and scannability.
   - **ENHANCE THE COPY**: Use `<b>...</b>` more frequently in the **descriptive_block_content** to highlight benefits, transformation points, or key emotional drivers. A true marketing copy uses bolding to guide the reader's eye to the most important "gems".
   - Example: "Our formula is <b>fast acting</b> and <b>stress free</b>."
2. **NO DASHES OR HYPHENS (STRICT)**: ABSOLUTELY NO hyphens (-), en-dashes (–), or em-dashes (—). Rewrite sentences to avoid them (e.g., use commas, colons, or new sentences). Compound words must be separated or rewritten (e.g. "stress free" instead of "stress-free").
3. **NO EMOJIS IN HERO BANNER (STRICT)**: ABSOLUTELY NO EMOJIS in `hero_title` or `hero_subtitle`.
4. **Internal Repetition**: Ensure `hero_title`, `hero_subtitle`, `descriptive_block_title`, and `descriptive_block_subtitle` are ALL UNIQUE. 
5. **Follow the Structure Map**: The Blueprint defines specific goals for each block.
   - 🎯 **CONTENT DISTRIBUTION**: Ensure the **Promotional Offer**, **Urgency**, and **Angle** are distributed across the blocks. 
   - **NUANCE**: If the Blueprint defines an **"Educational"** purpose, you do NOT need to include an Offer or Urgency. Focus purely on value and transformation.
   - 🎯 **EMOJI PACING**: If the Blueprint requests an emoji in the subject, provide exactly ONE.
6. **Adopt the Persona**: Use the voice/tone defined by the Persona Description.
7. **Commercial CTAs ONLY**: NEVER use "Learn More". Use "Shop Now", "Get Yours". Keep them SHORT (Max 13 chars).
8. **JSON OUTPUT ONLY**.
9. **PATCHING MINDSET (IF REVISION)**: If `REVISION FEEDBACK` is provided, do NOT restart. KEEP the good parts of the draft and only PATCH/FIX the specific issues requested. Enhance the existing copy rather than replacing it entirely unless instructed.
