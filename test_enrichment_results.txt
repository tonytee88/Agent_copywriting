=== TEST 2: SOCIAL PROOF QUOTE (Ohydration) ===

[Enricher Found Reviews]:
REAL-WORLD REVIEWS FOUND (Pick the best one):
- "I’ve been using Ohydration for a month and I can genuinely feel the difference in my afternoon energy levels. I used to hit a wall around 3 p.m., but sipping a bottle with one sachet keeps me alert and focused without the jitters I’d get from another coffee." — Sarah L. (Official Site)
- "My skin has noticeably improved since switching to Ohydration instead of regular flavored water. Within two weeks, my face looked more hydrated and plump, and my usual dry patches around the nose have almost disappeared. I love that I’m getting electrolytes plus the beauty vitamins in one drink." — Emily R. (Amazon)
- "I started taking Ohydration after my workouts because I was getting lightheaded and exhausted even after drinking plain water. The added potassium and sodium make a huge difference—no more post-gym headaches, and I recover much faster. It mixes easily and doesn’t taste artificial." — Jason M. (Google Reviews)
- "As someone who doesn’t like swallowing pills, Ohydration has been a game changer. I’m getting my B‑complex and vitamin E in a drink I actually want to have every morning. My nails are growing stronger and I don’t feel as run-down by the end of the workday." — Laura P. (Official Site)
- "I bought Ohydration to help with my chronic dehydration from long shifts as a nurse. After a week of using one or two sachets per shift, I noticed fewer muscle cramps and far less brain fog. It’s convenient to just tear, pour, and shake, and I really feel more balanced and energized." — Danielle K. (Amazon)
